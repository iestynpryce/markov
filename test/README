== TESTING ==

To run a set of tests against each of the markov programs written run:

    bash run_tests.sh


== PERFORMANCE ==

To get an idea of how the different language implementations of the markov
program compare run:

    bash run_timings.sh

This will output timeavg.out listing the programs and their average run time.
You can create a bar chart of this data by running:

    gnuplot barchart.gnuplot

Which will ouput timings.eps.
